# Kaprekar Constant Steps Calulator

`deployed to gh-pages --> https://oluwatobiloba2000.github.io/Kaprekar-Number-detector/`


***TASK***

Write an algorithm to compute the Kaprekar’s constant on any four-digit number. The
algorithm must do the following:

● Take only four-digit numbers whose digits are not identical.

● Return the number of steps taken to get to the Kaprekar’s constant (6174).

Example: using 3524.
5432 – 2345 = 3087
8730 – 0378 = 8352
8532 – 2358 = 6174
7641 – 1467 = 6174
This above example should return “3”, because it took 3 steps to get to the constant.
