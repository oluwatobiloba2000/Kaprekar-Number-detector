# Kaprekar Constant Steps Calulator

`Write an algorithm to compute the Kaprekar’s constant on any four-digit number. The
algorithm must do the following:
● Take only four-digit numbers whose digits are not identical.
● Return the number of steps taken to get to the Kaprekar’s constant (6174).
Example: using 3524.
5432 – 2345 = 3087
8730 – 0378 = 8352
8532 – 2358 = 6174
7641 – 1467 = 6174
This above example should return “3”, because it took 3 steps to get to the
constant.`
